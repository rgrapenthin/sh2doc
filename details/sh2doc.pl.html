	<td> This script runs though all directories specified in the field @DIRS and 

 looks at all files whether they contain special documentation makers like:

 <ul>

 <li>BRIEF</li> 

 <li>AUTHOR</li>

 <li>DETAILS</li>

 <li>DATE</li>

 <li>CHANGELOG</li>

 </ul>

 If any of these are found, the file is added to an overview contained in an 

 index.html file which lists file name (and a link to a detailed description).

 Furthermore another HTML file is created which contains detailed information

 of the file given in the documentation. Additional meta data of the file such as

 last changed could be added.<br/>

 A line that (starts with spaces only and) contains a comment starting with '+' 

 will be added to the details. <p>Empty lines or "" denote that the subsection

 (e.g. DETAILS) is finished. So use minimal HTML for paragraph formatting and line

 breaks. </p>

 fill @FILES with files found in directories given by @DIRS
 grep all files that are executable and not a directory
 sort filenames (depending on first letter of the file, not the full path!)
 iterate over all files and check whether they contain tagged comments
 read index file and include alphabet selection
 final writing of index file  ... this is inefficient, optimize, if you can!
